## Golden Age D&D Modules
Dive into a view of the great Dungeons and Dragons modules from the 80's!  This project is a recreation of a static comp layout, using these classic modules as inspiration.

The layout is responsive and can be viewed across screen sizes and devices.  Here's a view from an iPad:

## Overview of Project
This is a solo project for Module Two at Turing in which we were tasked to recreate the layout of a comp image. The specs and comp information for this project can be [found here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/static-comp-challenge.html).  We had the latitude to change images/fonts/colors/content but were expected to maintain the same layout as the image provided.  

The page was created to be responsive to varying screen sizes and devices.  The icons used in this page are from [font awesome](fontawesome.com), the cover images are from [this blog](https://rossonl.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/classic-dd-modules-ranked/), and the color pallet was found on [coolors](https://coolors.co/4281a4-48a9a6-e4dfda-d4b483-c1666b).  The data for the "module cards" is contained in the scripts.js file, and that information is processed on page load.

## Technologies used
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * Git
 * GitHub   

## Challenges
The main challenge in this project was applying previous lessons on CSS and HTML into this solo effort, within the confines of following the static comp image for layout and staying within the limited time alloted.  Flex and grid produced some challenges in getting the display layout to display properly across various screen sized and through different media queries.

## Wins
I was able to incorporate the skills and techniques learned at this point to match the comp layout.  I was also able to use what I've learned in JavaScript to create the framework for functionality of the page to be added later.  This was the first project to use a combination of flex/grid and media queries, and though this presented some challenges, I was ultimately successful in getting the desired responsive layout.

## Future Improvements
  * Create functionality to add interactivity to this page, which was not part of the project comp or rerquirements.  As the data is set up in the .js file, it would be relatively easy to add and remove module cards, as well as implement button functionality.
  * Refine the responsiveness of the layout (e.g. smoother transitions of lower half of module cards).
  * Improve contrast for image overlay icons.
  * Test for accessibility and make adjustments as needed.
